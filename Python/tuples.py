# Tuples are similar to lists but are different from
# lists in certain ways
coordinates = (4, 5)
print(coordinates[0])  # printing element at 0th index
# Tuples are immutable i.e. can't be modified once
# created (elements can't be removed or added further)
 
# Lists can be modified but Tuples can't be modified
